!Nun of the silence Of [eris]:

It is very it's a pity, but i do not have this book. And I cannot verify, you are worthy that, in order to read it. There is no time the book was divided beyond the parts, which were returned down the storage to guards, selected after salt and [Anais]. For obtaining the book you should pass testing in [Strazhnikov] and supervisors of treasures. If you want, I can send you to them.

The other day, I saw the most beautiful genesis trees! Absolutely stunning foliage. It made me think of Magmeld.<br>
Speaking of Magmeld, I keep getting letters from Magmeld Emissary Leader Lada, apparently he's board and wants me to come back. If I go back, you can bet I'll figure out a way to stay there a while. No use traveling all that way just to turn around and come back!<br>
Hm? What is Magmeld? You've never heard of Magmeld? Really?<br>
